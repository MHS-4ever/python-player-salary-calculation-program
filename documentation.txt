This is a program to calculate the salary of a football player based on their performance. The program uses a rating system to determine the player's overall ability and then maps it to a salary bracket.

The program prompts the user to enter data about the player's skills in the following categories: speed, shooting, passing, defending, dribbling, and physicality. It then calculates the overall rating of the player using a formula that takes into account the sum of the skills.

After calculating the overall rating, the program maps it to a salary bracket using predefined values. The salary brackets are defined using two lists: one for the salary values and another for the corresponding rating values.

The program then outputs the player's overall rating and salary on the console. It also stores the player's data in a dictionary data structure, which can be used to retrieve the player's information later on.

Additionally, the program uses the tabulate module to create a table of all the players' data. The table is stored in a .txt file called 'players_data.txt' in the same directory as the program.

Overall, this program provides a simple way to calculate the salary of a football player based on their performance, as well as store and retrieve player data using a dictionary data structure.
